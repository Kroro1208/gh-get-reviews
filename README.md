> 📝 **Track GitHub reviews you received** - The missing GitHub feature!

## 📦 Installation & Usage

```bash
# Option 1: Global installation
npm install -g get-gh-reviews
get-gh-reviews reviews -u YOUR_USERNAME

# Option 2: No installation needed (npx)
npx get-gh-reviews reviews -u YOUR_USERNAME

# Generate markdown report
npx get-gh-reviews reviews -u YOUR_USERNAME --markdown report.md
```

**Ever wondered who's been reviewing your code most frequently? Or what feedback patterns you're getting?**

`get-gh-reviews` is a powerful CLI tool that fills GitHub's gap by tracking all code reviews you've received across your repositories. Generate beautiful reports, discover review patterns, and level up your development workflow!

## ⭐ Why use this?

GitHub shows you "reviews requested" and lets you see "reviews given", but **there's no way to see all reviews you've received**. This tool solves that problem with:

- 🎯 **Complete review visibility** - See ALL reviews across ALL your PRs
- 📊 **Smart analytics** - Discover who reviews you most, review patterns, and more
- 📝 **Beautiful reports** - Generate shareable Markdown reports with enhanced table of contents
- 🔍 **Advanced filtering** - By time, organization, repository, and review status
- ⚡ **Lightning fast** - Efficient GitHub API usage with smart caching
- 🐱 **Cute loading animations** - Enjoy adorable characters while processing
- 📅 **Timeline view** - GitHub-style chronological display of reviews and replies

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Option A: Global Installation

1. **Install globally:**

   ```bash
   npm install -g get-gh-reviews
   ```

2. **Get your GitHub token:**
   - Visit [GitHub Settings > Tokens](https://github.com/settings/tokens)
   - Create a token with `repo` or `public_repo` scope

3. **Run the command:**
   ```bash
   get-gh-reviews reviews -u YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME -t YOUR_TOKEN
   ```

### Option B: No Installation (using npx)

```bash
npx get-gh-reviews reviews -u YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME -t YOUR_TOKEN
```

**💡 Tip:** If you get "command not found" error, use `npx` - it always works!

## 🔒 Security & Token Handling

This project follows safe practices for handling credentials and install-time behavior. Key points:

- Do NOT store long-lived tokens in repository files. Prefer environment variables (GITHUB_TOKEN) or your CI secret store.
- The CLI will create `~/.get-gh-reviews.env` only on first run and attempts to set restrictive file permissions (0600). Storing tokens in this file is optional and not recommended for shared machines.
- This package does not run `postinstall` or other automatic install-time scripts. If you are operating in a high-security environment, consider installing with `npm_config_ignore_scripts=1`.

If you discover a security issue, please open a GitHub Issue in this repository (preferable) and follow the reporting guidance in `.github/SECURITY.md`.

That's it! 🎉

## 📦 Installation

### Method 1: Global Installation (Recommended)

```bash
npm install -g get-gh-reviews
```

After installation, you can run the command directly:

```bash
get-gh-reviews reviews -u your-username --markdown my-reviews.md
```

### Method 2: Using npx (No installation required)

If you don't want to install globally or have permission issues:

```bash
npx get-gh-reviews reviews -u your-username --markdown my-reviews.md
```

### Troubleshooting Installation Issues

**If `get-gh-reviews` command is not found after global installation:**

1. **Check if it's installed globally:**

   ```bash
   npm list -g get-gh-reviews
   ```

2. **Find npm's global bin directory:**

   ```bash
   npm bin -g
   ```

3. **Add to your PATH (if needed):**

   ```bash
   # Add this to your ~/.bashrc or ~/.zshrc
   export PATH="$(npm bin -g):$PATH"
   ```

4. **Alternative: Use npx (always works):**
   ```bash
   npx get-gh-reviews --help
   ```

**For permission issues on macOS/Linux:**

```bash
# Option 1: Use npx (recommended)
npx get-gh-reviews reviews -u username

# Option 2: Fix npm permissions
sudo npm install -g get-gh-reviews
```

### Local Installation (as dependency)

```bash
npm install get-gh-reviews
```

## Setup Options

### Option 1: Use Token Directly (Recommended for first-time users)

```bash
get-gh-reviews reviews -u your-username -t your_github_token
```

### Option 2: Save Token in Config File (Convenient for regular use)

When you first run the tool, it automatically creates a config file at `~/.get-gh-reviews.env`. Just edit it:

```bash
# The tool will create this file automatically
nano ~/.get-gh-reviews.env

# Then replace 'your_token_here' with your actual token
GITHUB_TOKEN=ghp_your_actual_token_here
```

### Option 3: Environment Variable

```bash
export GITHUB_TOKEN="your_token_here"
get-gh-reviews reviews -u your-username
```

### Getting Your GitHub Token

1. Go to [GitHub Settings > Tokens](https://github.com/settings/tokens)
2. Click "Generate new token" → "Generate new token (classic)"
3. Select scopes:
   - ✅ `repo` (for private repositories)
   - ✅ `public_repo` (for public repositories only)
4. Copy the token (starts with `ghp_`)

## Common Usage Examples

## Development

This package is written in TypeScript. For development:

```bash
# Run TypeScript CLI directly
npm run dev -- reviews -u username

# Build the project
npm run build

# Run example
npm run example
```

## Troubleshooting

### ❌ "User/Organization not found" Error

- **Check your username spelling** (case-sensitive)
- **Verify the user exists**: Visit `https://github.com/your-username`
- **Check token permissions**: Make sure your token has `repo` or `public_repo` scope

### 🔑 Authentication Issues

- **Token format**: Should start with `ghp_` (Personal Access Token)
- **Token expiration**: Check if your token hasn't expired
- **Scope permissions**: Need `repo` for private repos, `public_repo` for public repos

### 📁 "No reviews found"

- **User has no PRs**: The username might not have any pull requests
- **Private repositories**: Need `repo` scope in your token to access private repos
- **Time filter too restrictive**: Try removing `-d` option or increasing the days

### 🌐 Network Issues

```bash
# Test GitHub API connectivity
curl -H "Authorization: token YOUR_TOKEN" https://api.github.com/user
```

### 💡 Still having issues?

1. **Verify your GitHub username**: `https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME`
2. **Test your token**: Try the curl command above
3. **Check token scopes**: Go to GitHub Settings > Tokens and verify permissions
